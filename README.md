Automated Wi‑Fi Deauthentication Tool

Author: Mandeep

Overview

This project is an automated Wi‑Fi deauthentication testing tool developed for cybersecurity research and wireless security assessment. The tool scans nearby Wi‑Fi networks, identifies connected clients, and performs controlled deauthentication testing in authorized environments. It is intended for educational use and penetration testing practice.

Tool Startup and Initialization

The tool begins by initializing the wireless interface and preparing the environment for monitoring and testing. During this stage, required checks are performed and the interface is configured to allow wireless packet monitoring. This confirms that the system is ready for scanning and analysis.

Wi‑Fi Network Scanning

After initialization, the tool scans nearby Wi‑Fi access points. It collects information about detected networks, including access point identifiers and operational details. This step helps identify potential target networks for security testing.

Client Detection

Once a target access point is selected, the tool detects wireless clients connected to that network. This stage analyzes client activity and associations, allowing the tester to understand how devices interact with the access point.

Automated Deauthentication Testing

In this phase, the tool performs automated deauthentication testing by sending deauthentication frames to selected clients. This demonstrates how vulnerable networks react to deauthentication events and helps evaluate resilience against wireless denial‑of‑service attacks.

Ethical and Legal Notice

This tool is developed strictly for educational, research, and authorized penetration testing purposes. Testing wireless networks without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always comply with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
